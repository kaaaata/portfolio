            I'm Catherine, a software engineer based in San Francisco, and this is how I arrived at where I am today.

          <p>
            In 2017, I was an Analyst working in financial services. One day, I realized that with Python & VBA scripting, much of my team's work could be automated. After writing these macros for a few months, I realized that I really loved coding, so I quit my job to fully pursue a career in software engineering. I invested three months in Hack Reactor, a top coding bootcamp in San Francisco, to learn fullstack web development in JavaScript. Since then, I have been devoting my energy to becoming the best software engineer I can be, learning new skills and working on fullstack web projects daily. Specific areas of interest to me include machine learning, AI, and statistics.

            Outside of coding, my interests include Chess and Dota 2.
