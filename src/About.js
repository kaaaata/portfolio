          I'm Cat, a software engineer based in San Francisco, with a background in finance and statistics.

        <p>
          In 2017, I was an analyst working at a financial services company. After realizing that Python and VBA scripting could automate a lot of the work we did, I began learning to code through independent study. After writing macros for a few months, I realized that I really loved programming, so I quit my job to fully pursue a career in software engineering. I invested three months into Hack Reactor, a top coding bootcamp in San Francisco, to learn fullstack web development using JavaScript. Since then, I have been working to become the best software engineer I can be, learning new skills and working on fullstack web projects daily. Specific areas of interest to me are machine learning, AI, and statistics.

          Outside of coding, I love to play Chess and Dota 2.
